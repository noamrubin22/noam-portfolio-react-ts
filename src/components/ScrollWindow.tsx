            <p>I am a dev (full stack).</p>
            <p>
              I like to combine the old with the new: nostalgia with innovation.
              Feeling with intellect.
            </p>
            <p>A futuristic nineties kid.</p>
            <p>
              I feel the best when I can be creative and learn new things.
              That's why I am happy to work in web3.
            </p>
            <p>I hope to bring a positive change into the space.</p>
